## The Issue:

- Exhibition viewing mode
- H=N permanent exhibit in a virtual museum

## Our Solution:
Actually, we created two different solutions.
For visual works, a simple gallery view. Just put in OBJKT numbers and you’re done. This is, in many ways, a more gallery-friendly version of https://objkts.gallery.
This idea is only sketches for now, they can be found at https://www.figma.com/file/EZsHWFIHW1VMqfvfsoqSHY/WG-7.2?node-id=2%3A2
For audio works, we created HEN Radio. A standalone minimal gallery for music and other audio works. We have a working prototype at https://tinyurl.com/HENradio.
Clickable Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/EZsHWFIHW1VMqfvfsoqSHY/WG-7.2?page-id=299%3A2&node-id=299%3A3&viewport=667%2C388%2C0.22890730202198029&scaling=min-zoom



### How it works:
For the visuals:
Step 1: go to hicetnunc.gallery (in the future)
Step 2: enter gallery details and select OBJKTs
Step 3: view the gallery in a browser on any device
Step 4: enjoy :)

### For the radio:
Step 1: go to https://tinyurl.com/HENradio
Step 2: enter a wallet address containing music / audio
Step 3: play your hicetnunc radio
Step 4: enjoy :)

### RoadMap

What did you do during the hackathon?
We sketched a simple standalone gallery that would allow users (galleries, museums, artists, ...) to exhibit works from hicetnunc more easily - both online and in a physical exhibition space.

We also prototyped a first version of a minimal “audio gallery” called HEN radio, playing audio works from a tezos wallet. 


What is missing to finish the project?
The visual gallery needs to be implemented, perhaps building on the work of https://objkts.gallery by @ishacbertran. 

HEN Radio could add support for adding OBJKTs instead of wallets only, for creating curated playlists. Additionally, there could be functionality for video works as well. 
There could also be a way to retribute artists and collectors when played.

In the end, both streams could be merged into a gallery that can display all kinds of works: audio, video, visual and interactive: hicetnunc.gallery
